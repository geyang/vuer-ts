/**
 * Represents the MuJoCo component within the Vuer application, facilitating the simulation and visualization of MuJoCo models.
 * This component is responsible for emitting frame update events (`ON_MUJOCO_FRAME`) to synchronize the simulation state across the application.
 *
 * Configures the MuJoCo simulation's behavior based on the playback's interaction state.
 *
 * The simulation's pause state and speed are dynamically adjusted to reflect the playback's
 * current actionâ€”recording, playing back, both, or neither. This ensures the simulation
 * accurately represents the desired scenario, with physics appropriately enabled or disabled.
 *
 *
 *
 * @param _ref A reference to the component instance, used for direct manipulation or access within the parent component.
 * @param _key A unique identifier for the MuJoCo simulation instance, defaulting to 'default'. This can be used to distinguish between multiple instances.
 * @param fps Frames per second for the simulation updates. This controls how often the `ON_MUJOCO_FRAME` events are emitted.
 * @param keyFrame The current key frame of the simulation. This is used to initialize the simulation state or to synchronize it with an external state.
 * @param pause A boolean indicating whether the simulation is currently paused. When true, frame updates are suspended.
 * @param speed The speed multiplier for the simulation. Allows for speeding up or slowing down the simulation playback.
 * @param props Additional props passed to the MuJoCo model component for further customization.
